# PNGTubie
Become a PNGTuber without using Discord. Runs in browser, based on mic activity level. https://josephsmendoza.github.io/PNGTubie/
## WIP
At the moment you must follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAy3rpxdb60) to use PNGTubie. You don't need to download anything or rename files, but you will still need to keep the window open and use obs filters. I plan on fixing this with future updates.
