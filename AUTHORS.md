from the original commit for this project, is assumed to have been authored by Minding for the purposed of [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33322681/checking-microphone-volume-in-javascript/64650826#64650826).
### [josephsmendoza](https://github.com/josephsmendoza)
All other contributions to this project, with the exception of all images in the [assets directory](https://github.com/josephsmendoza/PNGTubie/tree/main/assets),

### [Log:](https://logoo.carrd.co/)
The file [assets/logo.png](https://github.com/josephsmendoza/PNGTubie/blob/main/assets/logo.png), since the same commit that this file was introduced in,
was authored in its entirety by Log:, for the purpose of replacing the logo authored by Derpetti.
## Invitation to Merge
The new logo was included, and the default sprites removed,
in order to differentiate this program, which is FOSS, from the upstream program, which has since erased its history and obfuscated its source. The improvements made to this program are licenced under the AGPLv3+, which states that any program which makes use of a significant portion of this program must have its sources distributed or availible with the program, even when the program is served across the internet. The original purpose of this fork was to contribute improvements back to the upstream project, with the assumption that the upstream project was also open-source, however this is not possible with the current state of the upstream project. With this commit, the purpose of this fork changes to be an independant project for the purpose of "PNGTubing". Should the upstream project decide to embrace an open-source model as defined by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd) or the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software), by applying a licence to their project which is approved by the OSI or FSF, then the purpose of this fork will revert back to the original, and there will be no legal barrier to the inclusion of improvements made in this project to the upstream project. A branch of this project, [accessible here](https://github.com/josephsmendoza/PNGTubie/tree/pngtubie), will be devoted to maintaining a version of this program which is ready to be merged with the upstream project in such an event.
## Preperation for Split
At the time of writing, the main branch of this project continues to use files authored in their vast majority by Derpetti. Current work on this project will be dedicated to replacing all such files in preperation for the event that Derpetti should request the removal of all files they have authored. In the event Derpetti does request the removal of all files they authored, the ready to merge branch will be deleted, and the history of this repo up to the commit which fully complies with such a request will be erased, in order to reach full compliance, such that no version of this repo will contain any files authored by Derpetti.
